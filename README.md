## My Design Company Slogan: I have NO big families to feed, so won't Beg. Never L.A.M.P, so won't R.O.B. Clean, because I do digital design all the way till I got fired in my last consulting job as a senior associate, zero after-math; Critical, like all my Medium articles look like. I'm self aware, as a designer. That's what makes it DIVINE. Then, why do those people design for the sake of design?

Besides, I hereby acknowledge that I do not obtain any academic linkage with any design related educational program, due to the fact that none of my full time jobs are related with industrial design. Thus, I urge greater awareness of the distorted and ambiguous boundaries caused by irresponsible search engine practices. Please be advised that search results generated by Google may be largely subject to bias, potentially influenced by commercial interests or subjective defamation purposes.

## Less performative innovation, more real, continuous improvement.But of course, continuous improvement is hard, while performative innovation photographs beautifully. And corporations love a good photo.

## Why Keep Speaking Up - Design may represent 1–5% of the business, but somehow it absorbs the emotional labor of 95% of the dysfunction. Designers often end up dealing with the bulk of the chaos, stress, and organizational issues, even though they’re a small part of the company: Processes stretch out like an endlessly unspooling thread. Decisions evaporate in meetings. Priorities shift with the breeze of leadership’s latest epiphany. Sit at the intersection of conflicting teams, Deal with last-minute changes and shifting opinions, Translate vague ideas into actual solutions, Navigate politics disguised as “feedback,” Manage stakeholders who don’t understand design but want control over it, Smooth over communication breakdowns between product, engineering, marketing, and leadership, Face pressure to make something “look good” even when the underlying strategy is broken. In other words: Designers carry the dysfunctionally miserable product that has ambiguity, mess, boiled sea, contradictions, and political nonsense that other teams create. If you don’t keep speaking up, pushing, challenging — nothing moves. Not because people don’t recognize problems, but because acknowledging them requires effort. 

## The Combat: So when someone says, “You’re complaining,” remind them: No. You’re trying to fix a system everyone else has decided to simply survive. It takes ten times more energy to push something toward rightness than to passively watch it slide into mediocrity. You’re not complaining. You’re fighting entropy while everyone else applauds the chaos.
